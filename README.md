# Lumina Kitchen & Bar — A Dynamic Dining Experience
A sleek, high-performance single-page restaurant website built entirely with Vanilla JavaScript and Webpack. This project was developed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.thedoinproject.com) curriculum to master DOM manipulation and modular code design.

## 🍽️ About the Project
Lumina Kitchen & Bar is a fictional New American website. Unlike traditional multi-page sites, this project uses a Single Page Application (SPA) approach. Every element—from the sizzling menu items to the contact form—is injected into a single div#content using JavaScript modules.

## 🚀 Features
Zero-Reload Navigation: Switch between Home, Menu, and Contact tabs instantly via a custom-built tab switching logic.

Modular Component Architecture: Each "page" is a standalone ES6 module, keeping the codebase clean, scalable, and easy to debug.

Asset Bundling: Leverages Webpack to bundle CSS, images, and fonts into a single distribution folder.

Responsive Flavor: A mobile-first design approach ensuring the menu looks as good on a phone as it does on a desktop.

Dynamic Data Rendering: Menu items are generated from JavaScript objects, mimicking how real-world data might be handled.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+): For logic and DOM construction.

Webpack 5: For module bundling and development server.

CSS3: Custom styling (No external frameworks used).

HTML5: A single entry point file.

npm: For dependency management.

## 🧠 Technical Takeaways
While building this project, I focused on:

Thinking in Modules: Learning how to break a UI down into small, reusable JavaScript functions.

Webpack Configuration: Setting up css-loader, html-webpack-plugin, and managing output paths.

DOM Orchestration: Using document.createElement and appendChild efficiently to build complex layouts without touching the HTML file.
